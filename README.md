**Title: E-Blood Donation System**

### Introduction
This repository contains code and instructions for building an E-Blood Donation System. This system enables users to donate blood, request blood, and manage blood donation activities online. This README will guide you through understanding and setting up the PHP and MySQL-based E-Blood Donation System.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- PHP (with a web server such as Apache or Nginx)
- MySQL
- Composer (for PHP dependencies)

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**
   - Import the SQL file (`database.sql`) into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - If any PHP dependencies are used, run:
     ```
     composer install
     ```

### Project Overview
This E-Blood Donation System includes the following functionalities:
- User Registration and Login
- Blood Donation Registration
- Blood Request Submission
- View Blood Donation Requests
- View Donor List

### Project Structure
- **index.php**: Entry point of the application.
- **config.php**: Database configuration file.
- **includes/**: Contains PHP files for header, footer, and other includes.
- **assets/**: CSS, JS, and image files.
- **functions.php**: Contains PHP functions used across the application.
- **donate.php**: Allows users to register blood donations.
- **request.php**: Allows users to request blood.
- **donor_list.php**: Displays the list of donors.
- **requests.php**: Displays the list of blood donation requests.
- **profile.php**: User profile page.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Update the database configuration in `config.php` with your MySQL credentials.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration and login functionalities.

3. **Blood Donation Registration**:
   - Create a form to allow users to register their blood donations.

4. **Blood Request Submission**:
   - Implement a form for users to request blood.

5. **View Blood Donation Requests**:
   - Develop a page to display blood donation requests.

6. **View Donor List**:
   - Create a page to display the list of blood donors.

### Deployment
Deploy the PHP files to your web server. Ensure that your server has PHP and MySQL support.

### Usage
1. **Register as a User**:
   - Sign up as a user if you are not already registered.

2. **Donate Blood**:
   - Visit the "Donate Blood" page to register your blood donation.

3. **Request Blood**:
