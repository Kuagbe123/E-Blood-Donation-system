# Abstract
Data mining aims to transform raw data into a comprehensible format, encompassing database management, data preprocessing, and the application of various algorithms. The essence of data mining lies in automatically or semi-automatically analyzing large datasets to uncover hidden patterns and groups of data records.
                   The goal of data mining is to extract knowledge from a data set in a human-understandable structure and involves database and data management, data preprocessing. So many algorithms are using for the data mining process. The actual data-mining task is the automatic or semi-automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data records
